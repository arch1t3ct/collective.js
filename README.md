#collective.js

A simple tool for synchronizing data across multiple [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) instances*. 
Creates dual one-way tcp connections to each remote instance. Every data change is asynchronously 
sent to all of those instances. Very useful when using with 
[Cluster](http://nodejs.org/api/cluster.html) module, multiple servers, cloud instances, or any 
other multi [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) configuration.

*_Unstable. Use at your own risk. Is not suitable for systems which require 100% precision and 
synchronous data updates._

## Installation

```
npm install collective
```

## Usage

Every [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) instance has the same configuration with the exception of first 
parameter which must be unique.

### Node.js instance #1

```js
var Collective = require('collective');

var all_hosts = [{host: 'localhost', port: 8124}, 
    {host: 'localhost', port: 8125}
    // additional hosts #n
];

var collective = new Collective({host: 'localhost', port: 8124}, all_hosts, function (collective) {
    collective.set('foo.bar', 'quz');
    var foo_bar = collective.get('foo.bar');
});
```

### Node.js instance #2

```js
// Same as above.

var collective = new Collective({host: 'localhost', port: 8125}, all_hosts, function (collective) {
    collective.set('foo.bar', 'quz');
    var foo_bar = collective.get('foo.bar');
});
```

### Node.js instance #n*

```js
// Same as above.

var collective = new Collective({host: '#n.host', port: '#n.port'}, all_hosts, function (collective) {
    collective.set('foo.bar', 'quz');
    var foo_bar = collective.get('foo.bar');
});
```

*_Any (sane) amount of instances should work fine._

## Features

  * Non-blocking data synchronization across multiple [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) instances.
  * Deep object notation sets and gets ('foo.bar.quz.etc...'). 
  * Seamless scaling. One change in hosts configuration plus a restart and everything is up.
  * Virtually no slowdown due to data storage in javascript variable.

## Roadmap (v0.2.0)

  * Implement counters (+/-) and append.
  * Figure out proper race conditions prevention. 

## Possible bugs

  * Race conditions may occur (Unpredictable socket drain event).
  * Out of memory and connection choking conditions with large amounts of data.

## Testing and JSlint

Running the tests:
```
node tests/index.js
```

Checking code standards:
```
./build/jslint.sh
```
